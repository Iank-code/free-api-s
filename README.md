# free-api-s

I have created a list of free APIs to use

## Getting started

To start using the free API, you need this link

            https://free-api-s.vercel.app/

## API Endpoints

When viewing the API link, you will see there are several resources available. You can use those resources to access the API endpoint that you want to access.
For example, you can access the meals API endpoint using the following command

        https://free-api-s.vercel.app/meals

and you can access the films API endpoint using the following command

        https://free-api-s.vercel.app/films

This API endpoint accepts all the CRUD commands
